Oli on Sunday looked set for a return to power after winning his seat in parliament and his Communist UML party and Maoist allies on course to win a majority. Counting is still under way following an election on Thursday that capped a near-decade long transition to democracy from monarchy and a civil war in which more than 17,000 people died. Oli, 65, has vowed to form a government that lasts its full five-year term, something no prime minister has achieved since parliamentary democracy was established in 1990. His campaign has called for the extension of the Chinese railway network into Nepal and implement of hydroelectric, airport and other infrastructure projects to create jobs.  We can expect Oli to lead a stable government with the Maoists as strong allies,  said Bipin Adhikari, a constitutional expert.  Once there is political stability he can implement a development agenda and attract foreign investment.  Instability has spooked investors, curbed growth, spurred corruption and slowed reconstruction after a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people. Nepal is a natural buffer between China and India, with the ruling Nepali Congress party considered pro-India and the left alliance seen closer to China.  If Oli leads the new government, he will be forced to be pragmatic in maintaining a geo-political balance with both,  said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times. Final election results are expected to take about a week, election officials said. Home to Mount Everest, Nepal is one of the world s poorest countries.\",\n          \"U.S. Homeland Security officials met with major U.S. airlines and a trade group on Thursday to discuss the impact of possibly expanding a ban on large electronic gadgets on planes to flights from some European airports, three sources briefed on the meeting said. The afternoon meeting included high level executives from Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), United Airlines Inc (UAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and trade group Airlines for America, the sources said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the confidential meeting. The airlines and group declined to comment. In March, the United States announced laptop restrictions on flights originating from 10 airports including in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey because of fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken onto aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes.  The Trump administration is likely to include some European countries in the in-cabin ban on gadgets larger than cellphones and is reviewing how to ensure lithium batteries stored in luggage do not explode in midair, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan declined to discuss the meeting. He said on Wednesday that no final decision had been made on expanding the restriction and there would be no announcement on Thursday. One issue that had been expected to come up at the meeting was how much advance notice airlines would get to impose additional restrictions, which some airline officials say would require hiring more staff. In 2016, 30 million people flew to the United States from Europe, according to U.S. Transportation Department data. A broader ban would have a significant impact U.S. and European carriers, which are concerned about the challenges of checking large numbers of devices. Some U.S. and European airlines have been planning for a wider ban, industry officials have told Reuters. Earlier Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly met with senators from relevant oversight committees in a secure Capitol Hill facility to deliver a classified briefing to discuss numerous security issues \\u201cincluding threats to aviation,\\u201d Lapan said. A congresional official said it appeared that Homeland Securitiy was likely to expand the ban soon, but did not say when or to what airports. Kelly said last month the ban was likely to expand, given the sophisticated threats in aviation and intelligence findings that would-be attackers were trying to hide explosives in electronic devices.\",\n          \"Khaled Khatib, a Syrian rescue worker who served as a cinematographer on the   documentary short \\u201cThe White Helmets,\\u201d has been barred by American officials from traveling to Los Angeles for Sunday\\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked Mr. Khatib after discovering \\u201cderogatory information\\u201d about him. Mr. Khatib had planned to fly from Istanbul to Los Angeles on Saturday. The AP said he had been detained earlier in the week by Turkish officials for undisclosed reasons, and that he needed a passport waiver to travel to the United States, which was denied. Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was also to attend the Oscars there was no indication that his plans were upended. Mr. Khatib had planned to attend the ceremony after the Trump administration\\u2019s travel ban was lifted. The ban had halted or slowed travel from seven   countries, including Syria, but it was frozen by the courts. A member of the White Helmets, a group that searches for survivors in the rubble of   buildings, Mr. Khatib also filmed the group\\u2019s rescue efforts for the   film, which was made for Netflix and directed by Orlando von Einsiedel. In an interview with The Times earlier this month, Mr. Khatib said he hoped his appearance at the Oscars would convey the urgent message of the movie, and pressure President Bashar  \\u2019s regime and the Russian government to stop bombing Syrian civilians.

Representative Adam Schiff, the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee\\u2019s ranking Democrat, said documents that officials at the White House provided to the panel\\u2019s chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, would be made available to all the members of his committee and their Senate counterparts. \\u201cThis action is long overdue and follows an inexplicable series of events in which the White House played a role in selectively and surreptitiously providing the documents to our chairman,\\u201d Schiff said in a statement. \\u201cIf the White House had any concerns over these documents, or any other documents, they should have provided them to our committee weeks ago,\\u201d he said. Congressional committees and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating what U.S. intelligence has  concluded were attempts by Moscow to influence the U.S. election in Trump\\u2019s favor.  They are also looking at links between Russia and Trump. Russia denies such allegations. Trump and his allies have mounted an aggressive defense. Most recently, they have focused on unsubstantiated reports that Susan Rice, former President Barack Obama\\u2019s national security adviser, disclosed the names of Trump aides swept up by surveillance of foreign targets. Rice dismissed the reports as \\u201cabsolutely false\\u201d in an interview with MSNBC. The day after FBI Director James Comey confirmed the FBI investigation of potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign last month, Nunes announced to reporters that the communications of members of Trump\\u2019s transition team were caught up in the surveillance. He said the information came from documents obtained from a source he would not identify. Nunes, a close Trump political ally, discussed the matter with the Republican president before consulting committee Democrats. After reports Nunes got the documents from White House aides, Schiff called for him to recuse himself from the inquiry, saying his actions compromised the panel\\u2019s ability to complete a credible, bipartisan investigation.  Republican Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose leaders have insisted they can conduct a bipartisan investigation, said on Tuesday he was open to looking into the Rice allegations, if they proved true. Democrats underscored the gravity of the investigation. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t be surprised after all of this is said and done that some people end up in jail,\\u201d Representative Joaquin Castro, a House Intelligence member, told CNN.\",\n          \"As detectives scoured every inch of the bomb scene in Chelsea on Sunday, New Yorkers were conducting their own investigations. But theirs were turned inward, as they felt around for the psychological shrapnel that an explosion on a busy city street is designed to release, as damaging in its way as the kind that tears into flesh. A walk around Manhattan revealed glimpses of these inquiries, quiet but as intense as those beneath the emergency klieg lights. Suzie Shapiro got as close as she could to the scene on Sunday. \\u201cIt\\u2019s less scary if you see it,\\u201d she said, adding that she had done her best to explain the explosion to her two young children at home. \\u201cThis is the reality of being a kid right now. \\u201d On an uptown subway on Sunday, a group of   singers performed just as they do every other day, but added as they left the train, \\u201cBe safe out there. \\u201d Moments later, the F train bypassed the 23rd Street station near the bomb scene \\u201cdue to a police investigation. \\u201d The conductor spoke in bored tones over the intercom, as if it were like any other incident. From her apartment a block away from the explosion, the singer Rosanne Cash wrote on Twitter: \\u201cWe are safe and well. Appreciate the love + concern. \\u201d And another neighbor nearby, Graham Mills, 52, seemed unsurprised. \\u201cIt was only a matter of time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s kind of this New York spirit that\\u2019s like, whatever. Let\\u2019s get on with life. \\u201d Getting on with life in New York has been a work in progress for at least 15 years. In 2010, a car bomb was found in a Nissan Pathfinder parked in Times Square, though it did not detonate. The episode rattled the city even as residents spoke of the proverbial dodged bullet. But the bullet is always out there, as Saturday night reminded everyone. No lives were lost. Had New York dodged another one?    Natalie Wollen did not think so. She said she did not want to leave her Chelsea apartment all day on Sunday, but did so to walk her dog. \\u201cI\\u2019m still scared,\\u201d she said, her lips quivering. She had heard reports, which were later retracted, of a third bomb. \\u201cIf there were three already, there could be another one,\\u201d she said. Another dog walker, Sipho Simela, 31, stepped out into the day, but with a shrug, perhaps more appropriate to his age. \\u201cMy wife was like, \\u2018What are you going to do? \\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd I said, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to walk the dog. \\u2019\\u201d Years after Sept. 11, 2001, some New Yorkers still use that day as a guide, a measure for examining anxiety not unlike the   sign outside the scary ride in an amusement park. When something like this happens, they ask themselves, does this day feel as bad as that day, that line on the wall of my psyche? Better? Worse? \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel anywhere near that kind of intensity,\\u201d said Merril Stern, sitting in a Starbucks near the blast site. Similarly, Tyschelle Doucette from Queens was greeted by Mayor Bill de Blasio, and she told him, as if seeking to reassure the leader of a jittery city: \\u201cI was here for  . If it\\u2019s happening, it\\u2019s happening. \\u201d The mayor called her an example to other New Yorkers. For Will Finnegan, 31, a former Marine, the news of the blast brought him back to the   levels he worked in while deployed for five years in Afghanistan, he said. He went to work checking on friends in the neighborhood. \\u201cI understand how to mitigate stress and fear,\\u201d he said. Likewise, his roommate, Brandon Lanham, 31, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, said, \\u201cI\\u2019m almost too calm to a fault. \\u201d He said he found solace in the aftermath of the blast: \\u201cI\\u2019m assuming it\\u2019s someone that wants attention and is an American. It was not well placed. \\u201d For others, the images of the explosion, as seen on television and smartphone screens (a bright flash and people running away, looking back over their shoulders) belonged somewhere else. Somewhere far away. \\u201cNew Yorkers, we see now, here, what we have seen only abroad,\\u201d said James Mitchell, 54, an    driver. \\u201cChickens have come home to roost. \\u201d He thought back to 2001 and found something more troubling in the Chelsea explosion, he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s different, because the target is more random than specific,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt really makes me feel that life is getting really cheap in this world. \\u201d Natalie, the    walking her dog, said she was like everyone else born in the past 15 years. \\u201cSince we weren\\u2019t alive for   we\\u2019ve never been alive in a time when we aren\\u2019t scared,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve learned to accept that this stuff is going to happen. \\u201d Downtown, sitting on a bench in the West Village, a    mother, Maria Lugo, might beg to differ. To be a parent in these times is to know fear, she said. She grew up in the Bronx, where \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t even allowed to go outside and play. \\u201d Now she has a    son. \\u201cI am still worried about the bullies, the drug dealers, the killings, the shootings, the stabbings. Plus, I am also concerned about this. \\u201d She is struggling, like so many others, to place the Chelsea bomb in the context of her life and manage the anxiety it brought. \\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t eased up,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhen can you say, \\u2018You know what? It\\u2019s O. K.\\u2019? You\\u2019re always worried about something. \\u201d Back in Chelsea, across the street from the scene of the blast, a    boy, Aiden Li, gave his account of the event: \\u201cI heard the thunder,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI climbed up on Papa. \\u201d His father, Kyle Li, did not correct him. But he mourned what he said he lost on Saturday night. \\u201cAcross from my house, that Dumpster is sitting there in pieces,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd now the whole city looks different to me. \\u201d\",\n          \"When President-elect Donald Trump returns to this factory town on Friday for a victory celebration, he will find a region that is already experiencing the manufacturing renaissance he promised on the campaign trail. With local factories employing more workers than any time since the late 1990s, assembly line jobs are not hard to find. Those that pay a decent wage, however, are harder to come by. \\u201cWe can barely make ends meet and we\\u2019re stuck going nowhere,\\u201d said auto parts worker Michael Baum, 22, as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot of a Family Dollar discount store.  Trump won the White House thanks to strong support from workers in Midwestern cities like Grand Rapids who have seen their living standards erode as the United States shed manufacturing jobs. He beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by a margin of 14 percent in the four counties that make up the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, helping him carry Michigan by a margin of 0.27 percent. Trump has promised to punish companies that shift work overseas, pressuring manufacturers like United Technologies Corp. to reverse their outsourcing plans. \\u201cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,\\u201d Trump said at a rally here the night before the Nov. 8 election.  Grand Rapids, a hub of furniture makers and auto parts suppliers, has not been immune to outsourcing. At least 488 people have lost their jobs over the past year as two manufacturers, Dematic Corp and Leon Automotive Interiors, have shifted work to other countries, U.S. Labor Department filings show. But new hiring has more than made up for those losses. The number of factory jobs in the region has grown by 40 percent since the depths of the recession in 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and unemployment stands at 2.9 percent, well below the national average of 4.6 percent.  Local businesses now say their top concern is finding qualified workers, according to Rick Baker, president of the Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce. Even as jobs have returned to Grand Rapids, earnings remain low. At $846 per week, average weekly wages in the region rank 46th among the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, BLS data show. The Heart of West Michigan United Way, a local charity, said demand for its services has remained steady over the past several years even as the economy has picked up.  While manufacturing helped lift millions of unskilled workers into the U.S. middle class in the 20th Century, that is no longer the case, said Lou Glazier, president of Michigan Future, a think tank that focuses on the state\\u2019s economy. Factories still pay good wages to workers who have specialized skills, such as welding or computer programing, but routine work no longer pays enough to cover living expenses, he said. Grand Rapids is \\u201cparticipating in the old economy and doing well in it, in terms of jobs. It\\u2019s just that the economy is no longer producing high wages,\\u201d Glazier said. While Trump and others blame global competition for the decline in factory work, automation has played a large role as well, economists say. The U.S. manufacturing sector has more than doubled output over the past 35 years even as it had shed one-third of its work force, according to the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. \\u201cWe\\u2019re doing more today with the same amount of people that we had eight years ago,\\u201d said Bob Roth, chief executive officer of RoMan Manufacturing, which make glass and electrical components.  At RoMan, assembly line workers start at $13 per hour but skilled workers can earn up to $30 an hour, Roth said. The company pays community college tuition for those who wish to upgrade their skills, but those who fail to improve their productivity enough to justify a higher wage within two years are fired, he said. Such prospects come as little consolation to workers like Baum, who are trying to figure out a way to boost their earnings on their own. For now, they are pinning their hopes on Trump. \\u201cIf he can bring good paying jobs back to America,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll vote for him again.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Trump leaves Nov. 3 on a trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be his first tour of Asia since taking power in January and one with a major priority: Preventing the standoff with North Korea from spiraling out of control. Xi is immersed in a Communist Party Congress expected to culminate in him consolidating his control and potentially retaining power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place. Trump believes that Xi should have even more leverage to work on the North Korea problem.  The president s view is you have even less of an excuse now,  said one official.  He s not going to step lightly.  Trump wants to gain some serious cooperation from China to persuade Pyongyang to either change its mind or help deprive it of so much resources that it has no choice but to alter its behavior, the official said. Trump has heaped praise on Xi in recent weeks in hopes of gaining Chinese cooperation and has held back from major punitive trade measures. In an interview with Fox Business Network s Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he wants to  keep things very, very low key  with Xi until the Chinese leader emerges from the party congress.  I believe he s got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We ll see what happens. Now with that being said, we re prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you wouldn t believe,  Trump said in the interview, to air on Sunday. Trump has traded bitter insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, using his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month to dismiss Kim as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission for his repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. He said if threatened, the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea. Kim in recent weeks said the United States would face an  unimaginable strike  from North Korea if provoked. CIA chief Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that North Korea could be only  months  away from gaining the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons.\",\n          \"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\\u2019s the  .) Good evening. Here\\u2019s the latest. 1. The battle to retake Iraq\\u2019s   city from the Islamic State has begun. We have two reporters and a photographer near the front lines as Kurdish pesh merga troops advance on villages east of Mosul. The fight could take weeks or months and involve up to 30, 000 Iraqi and Kurdish troops with American air support. Next door in Syria, the Islamic State lost a small town, Dabiq, with huge symbolic import. An Islamic prophecy identifies Dabiq as the site of an apocalyptic battle. The Islamic State has used that message in its propaganda, even naming its magazine after the town. ____ 2. Hillary Clinton, brimming with confidence and boosted by poll numbers across the United States, is beginning an ambitious assault on traditionally Republican states to further diminish support for Donald Trump. But her critics seized on newly released documents that include discussion of a possible \\u201cquid pro quo\\u201d to settle a dispute between the State Department and the F. B. I. over the classification of one of her emails. Spontaneous and relatively silent protests against Mr. Trump are emerging across the country as some voters take aim at perhaps his most prized possession: his brand name. His wife, Melania, broke her long,   silence, calling his behavior toward women \\u201cinappropriate\\u201d but insisting, \\u201cWe are moving on. \\u201d ____ 3. More than 170 countries signed a sweeping deal on Saturday to cut hydrofluorocarbons, used in   and refrigerators, which could be even more   than the Paris climate accord. And it might not have happened without the active backing of the world\\u2019s chemical companies, who are disrupting their own businesses to fight climate change. ____ 4. Rolling Stone went to court in an $8 million defamation trial. It\\u2019s the first of two lawsuits the magazine faces over a discredited 2014 article that described a brutal gang rape at the University of Virginia. The magazine, which retracted the article, is facing an associate dean who says she was smeared. The second case, filed by the fraternity whose house, above, was portrayed as the setting for the rape, seeks $25 million in damages. ____ 5. Tales of survival are emerging from Haiti, where a hurricane killed hundreds this month. In one ravaged area, villagers said they took shelter in caves  \\u2014   and will have to keep doing so until they can rebuild their homes. Until then, they\\u2019ll continue to flee to the caves when it rains. \\u201cIt is our house that God created when we most needed it,\\u201d one resident said. ____ 6. To the first lady, with love. We published essays in praise of Michelle Obama from four boldfaced names: the authors Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Jon Meacham, the actress Rashida Jones and the activist Gloria Steinem. \\u201cMichelle Obama may have changed history in the most powerful way  \\u2014   by example,\\u201d Ms. Steinem wrote. ____ 7. The Museum of Modern Art is expanding its collection of Latin American art thanks to a donation of 102 works, including \\u201cVisible Idea,\\u201d above, by Waldemar Cordeiro. \\u201cThis is a transformative gift,\\u201d the museum\\u2019s director said. ____ 8. Is there no joy in football? Penalties for ostentatious celebration of scores are up sharply this season. The New York Jets, meanwhile, had little reason to celebrate on Monday night as the Arizona Cardinals defeated them   in Phoenix. (ESPN) ____ 9. Hundreds gathered at Carnegie Hall to remember Bill Cunningham, the beloved Times street fashion photographer, who died in June at age 87. The speakers included the Vogue editor Anna Wintour and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It was not hard to imagine what Mr. Cunningham\\u2019s reaction would have been to the scene. He would have been on the sidewalk outside, his bike parked nearby, snapping photos of guests as they arrived. ____ 10. Finally, some Canadians, fearing the American election was depressing their neighbors to the south, took to social media to share reassuring messages about how great the United States is. They praised Americans\\u2019 contributions to music, technology, philanthropy and   \\u2026     the list goes on. The project was started by a creative agency that says it is not trying to sell anything. \\u201cSome people have tweeted that they think Justin Trudeau would win the election as a   candidate,\\u201d the agency\\u2019s head said. \\u201cBut we are not giving him up. \\u201d Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
